# ðŸŽ® Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a fun twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game.  
Instead of playing on one board, you play on **9 smaller boards** arranged in a 3x3 grid â€” where each move dictates where the opponent plays next.  

This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
